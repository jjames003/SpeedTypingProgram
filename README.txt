This program is a game to see how fast and accurate you can retype a given sentence.
Note: In order for the game to run properly, make sure to download the sentences.txt as well as install tkinter and difflib by using pip install.

First, the program will prompt you to enter your name. Next, it will ask if you'd like to see the leaderboards before you play (maybe to gain inspiration to do well). This is based on previous results by other people.
The leaderboards are sorted by time and accuracy. For example, the person in first place will have the highest accuracy and the shortest time. As soon as you close out of the leaderboard screen, the game will begin.
Type the sentence as accurately and quickly as you can and then click Submit. If you don't want to play again, exit out of the window. If you do, as soon as you click the submit button, the next round will start. You can keep going until you want to stop. All the results of completed rounds will be saved in results.txt.
